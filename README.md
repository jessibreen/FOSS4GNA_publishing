# Writing for the FOSS4GNA Special Issue: Tips for First-Time Authors

Whether you’re new to academic publishing or just new to this journal, here are a few friendly tips to help get your talk from slides to article.

## Structure: Use What You Know

You don’t need a fancy structure — clear and simple is great.

**Classic scientific-style outline works well:**
- What was the problem or context?
- What did you do (tools, data, workflow)?
- What happened or what did you learn?
- What should someone else take away from this?

Think well-documented GitHub README but with more narrative.

## Voice and Clarity

- Write like you’re explaining your project to a smart peer from another field
- Use plain language and short paragraphs
- Avoid acronyms if you can, but if you use them, explain them
- Use an active voice where possible
- It's okay to write in your natural voice

## Citations (Don’t Overthink It)

- **Zotero** is great if you're citing multiple sources
- If you're only referencing a few tools, datasets, or papers, the copy-paste citations on **Google Scholar** are fine
- You can cite:
  - Software
  - Code libraries
  - Datasets
  - Documentation
  - Blog posts (yes, really)

##  Publishing Data

Publishing your data helps others build on what you’ve done and gives your work longevity.

**Good data sharing options:**
- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) – integrates with GitHub, assigns DOIs
- [Figshare](https://figshare.com) – good for datasets and figures
- [Dryad](https://datadryad.org) – often used in environmental sciences
- Institutional repositories — check with your library

**What to include:**
- A **README** that explains what the dataset is, how it was collected, and how to use it
- A **license** (e.g. CC0, ODC-BY) so others know how they can reuse it
- A **citation suggestion** so you get credit
